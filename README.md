# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis Project** repository.  
This repository is designed to document and analyze requirements for a **Booking Management System**, simulating real-world software development practices.  

## Purpose of This Repository
The main purpose of this repository is to:
- Demonstrate the **Requirement Analysis** phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
- Provide a structured blueprint for understanding and documenting software requirements.
- Prepare for future development by ensuring clarity, precision, and alignment between stakeholders and developers.

## What This Repository Contains
As you go through the project, this repository will include:
- Explanations of **Requirement Analysis** and its role in SDLC.
- Documentation of **Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**.
- **Use Case Diagram** for the Booking Management System.
- Structured breakdown of **key activities** in Requirement Analysis.
- **Acceptance Criteria** examples for core features.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the discipline of discovering, eliciting, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and constraints of stakeholders for a software system. It translates business goals into clear, testable, and traceable requirements that guide design, implementation, and verification.

At its core, Requirement Analysis answers three questions:
1. **What problem are we solving?** (business goals, scope, assumptions)
2. **For whom are we solving it?** (stakeholders, users, external systems)
3. **What must the system do and how well must it perform?** (functional and non-functional requirements)

### Objectives
- **Alignment:** Establish a shared understanding between business stakeholders, product, engineering, QA, and operations.
- **Clarity:** Convert ambiguous ideas into **unambiguous**, **testable**, and **prioritized** requirements.
- **Risk reduction:** Surface constraints, dependencies, and edge cases early, when changes are cheaper.
- **Traceability:** Create a chain from business objectives → features → detailed requirements → tests → releases.

### Typical Deliverables
- Problem statement and success metrics
- Stakeholder and actor definitions
- Glossary and domain model (business entities, relationships)
- **Functional Requirements** (capabilities, behaviors, rules, workflows)
- **Non-Functional Requirements** (performance, security, availability, compliance, usability)
- Acceptance criteria and examples (Given/When/Then)
- Use cases / user stories / scenarios
- Prototypes or diagrams (e.g., use-case, context, data flow)
- Traceability matrix (requirements ↔ tests)

### Quality Criteria for Good Requirements
- **Correct** (reflect stakeholder intent)  
- **Complete** (cover necessary scenarios and constraints)  
- **Consistent** (no conflicts)  
- **Feasible** (achievable within constraints)  
- **Unambiguous** (single interpretation)  
- **Verifiable** (testable/measureable)  
- **Traceable** (linkable to business goals and tests)  
- **Prioritized** (MoSCoW or similar)

### Why Requirement Analysis Matters in the SDLC
Requirement Analysis is foundational to every subsequent SDLC phase:

- **Planning & Estimation:** Reliable requirements enable realistic timelines, budgets, and resource plans.
- **Architecture & Design:** Clear behaviors and quality attributes drive architectural choices (e.g., availability targets influence replication and failover strategies).
- **Implementation:** Developers code against well-defined inputs/outputs, states, and constraints—reducing rework.
- **Testing:** Acceptance criteria and non-functional targets become the basis for test cases, performance tests, and definition of done.
- **Deployment & Operations:** Operational requirements (SLOs, logging, monitoring, compliance) are specified up front, avoiding production gaps.
- **Change Management:** Traceability enables impact analysis when requirements evolve (inevitable in iterative/agile delivery).

### Example (Booking Management System)
- **Functional:** “A customer can search available rooms by location, date range, and occupancy; the system must prevent double-booking at confirmation time.”
- **Non-Functional:** “Search results must return within **≤2s** for 95% of requests under **10k** concurrent users; payment flows must be **PCI-DSS compliant**; availability must be **99.9%** monthly.”

> In iterative/agile contexts, Requirement Analysis is **continuous**: you refine user stories, acceptance criteria, and models as understanding grows—while preserving traceability and quality standards.
